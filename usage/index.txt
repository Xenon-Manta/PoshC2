Using PoshC2 
#############

Once PoshC2 is setup and running you can find all relevant project data in the **ROOTDIR** project folder, by default `/opt/PoshC2_Python`.

This includes:

* The project database.
* Log files.
* The Apache mod_rewrite rewrite rules if using a C2 Proxy.
* A `payloads` directory with all the generated payloads. Any additional payloads you want to use in PoshC2 should be placed in here.
    * Any relevant information on using the payloads, such as DLL entry points, are logged in the C2 Server log when it starts up.
* A `downloads` directory for any files that get downloaded using the Implants.
* A `reports` directory for any reports generated by PoshC2.

Once a payload is successfully executed, an Implant will be check in and a message will be displayed in the C2 Server log:

.. image:: ./new-implant.png
    :width: 1233   
    :align: center

This should also be available in the Implant-Handler:


.. image:: ./implant-handler-new-implant.png
    :width: 897
    :align: center

At this stage, the Implant is ready to receive commands from the user.

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2
