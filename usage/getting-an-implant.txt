Getting an Implant
##################

Once a payload is successfully executed, an Implant will be check in and a message will be displayed in the C2 Server log:

.. image:: ./new-implant.png
    :width: 1233   
    :align: center

This will detail useful information such as the the Implant ID, the Implant type and the environment it is running in.

The Implant Types can be summarised as:

* PS - PowerShell Implant.
* C# - C# Implant that does not use System.Management.Automation.dll.
* PY - Python Implant.

These can also have suffixes depending on the Implant sub-type:

* ;D - A Daisy Implant that is achieving C2 communications by daisy-chaining traffic through another implant.
* ;P - A Proxy Implant with hard-coded Proxy credentials.

Some other notes:

* If the user's username has a * as a suffix then the Implant is running in an elevated context.

The Implant will also be available in the Implant-Handler once it is refreshed by pressing Enter:

At this stage, the Implant is ready to receive commands from the user.
