Implants
########

As previously mentioned, PoshC2 has three types of Implant:

* **PowerShell** - a PowerShell based Implant that does **not** use `PowerShell.exe` but instead interacts with `System.Management.Automation.dll` directly.
    * This Implant allows the user to load any PowerShell module and execute any PowerShell cmdlets from the Implant prompt.
    * PowerShell version 2 and version 4 payloads exist.
* **Sharp** - a C#.NET Implant that does not use any PowerShell related functionality at all and does not interact with any PowerShell components.
    * This Implant can run C# executables in memory, such as BloodHound and the GhostPack binaries from SpectreOps.
* **Python** - a Python3 Implant that requires Python3 on the target in order to execute, but allows the user to run arbitrary Python3 code and load Python3 scripts.

Using an Implant
####################

The Implant-Handler window will not refresh the implant check-in times automatically, however, if you hit the [enter] key without any values in the input field it will refresh the implant window and update the last checked in times/dates. 
If you then wish to use one of the implants type the ID value and hit enter and this will put you into a prompt like follows ``1``::

	PS 1>

If you want to select more than one implant, you can provide a comma separated list ``1,2,3,4``::

	1,2,3>

Finally, you can select ALL implants by typing ``ALL``::

	ALL>

The Implant-type is displayed just to the left of the prompt, unless multiple Implants have been selected.

The Implant Types can be summarised as:

* PS - PowerShell Implant.
* C# - C# Implant that does not use System.Management.Automation.dll.
* PY - Python Implant.

These can also have suffixes depending on the Implant sub-type:

* ;D - A Daisy Implant that is achieving C2 communications by daisy-chaining traffic through another implant.
* ;P - A Proxy Implant with hard-coded Proxy credentials.

Once at the Implant prompt, commands that are executed are issued to the Implant(s). 
Context sensitive help and history is provided to assist in commands. See the Help section for more information.

When a command is issued to an Implant it is issued as a Task with a particular identifier. This identifier can be seen in the C2 server log along with the executing user when a Task is picked up by an Implant.
When an Implant responds to a particular task, it does so using the same Identifier, allowing command input and output to be correlated directly, and actions attributed to users.

Note that if PowerShell output is truncated then, as in PowerShell directly, the user can pipe the command to `Format-List` or its alias `fl` to retrieve the full output.

Note that any tasks that are run automatically, such as the loading of certain modules, are performed as the **autoruns** user.

Loading and Running modules
***************************

Any PowerShell script can be loaded by the PowerShell implant and executed in memory:

.. code-block:: powershell

    loadmodule MyPowerShellScript.ps1
    Invoke-MyCmdlet

Or similarly for Python Implant

.. code-block:: powershell

    loadmodule MyPythonScript.py
    my_python_function("arg")

The C# Implant also has the ability to load and execute modules in memory, but these modules are C#.NET executables.
These modules are invoked through .NET reflection and do not touch disk, and PoshC2 requires a few extra bits of information.

* The Namespace of the class containing the **Main** method
* The Class name of the class containing the **Main** method
* The Assembly name

.. code-block:: powershell

    loadmodule MySharpStuff.exe 
    run-exe Namespace.Class Assembly <args> 

For example, if the below code was compiled into an executable:

.. code-block:: powershell

    using System;

    namespace ConsoleApp1
    {
        class MySuperProgram
        {
            static void Main(string[] args)
            {
                if (args.Length >= 1)
                {
                    Console.WriteLine(args[0]);
                }
            }
        }
    }
 
Then we can see the namespace is **ConsoleApp1**, and the class is **MySuperProgram**

The Assembly Name can be found in Visual Studio by right-clicking the project (not the solution) and choosing `Properties`

.. image:: ./assemblyname.png
    :width: 867 
    :align: center

Alternatively it can be found in the Projects **.csproj** file:

.. image:: ./assemblynamei2.png
    :width: 1554
    :align: center

In this case the Assembly Name is **PwnStuff**.

The command then to run the executable and print "PoshC2Rocks" would be:

.. code-block:: powershell

    run-exe ConsoleApp1.MySuperProgram PwnStuff PoshC2Rocks 

.. image:: ./run-exe.png

    :width: 1023 
    :align: center

There is also a ``run-dll`` command which works exactly the same way as ``run-exe`` for C#.NET DLLs, however there is one additional argument which specifies the entry point (and the class and namespace must match that of this entrypoint):

.. code-block:: powershell

    run-dll ConsoleApp1.MySuperProgram PwnStuff MyEntryMethod PoshC2Rocks
