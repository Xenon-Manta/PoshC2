Post-Implant Help
##################
The help is split out into two main components, "Pre-Implant Help" and "Post-Implant Help". This is basically depending on when you type help, will depend on the help that is provided. 

To obtain the help in either sections type ``Help`` or ``?``.

The "Post-Implant" help aims to help when issuing commands against the implants. The help has been split out in the following items. 

* Implant Features
* Privilege Escalation
* File Management
* Persistence
* Network Tasks / Lateral Movement
* Active Directory Enumeration
* Domain Trusts
* Domain / Network Tasks
* Lateral Movement
* Credentials / Tokens / Local Hashes (Must be SYSTEM)
* Credentials / Domain Controller Hashes
* Useful Modules
* Implant Handler

To split up the output, we have enabled the user to type help with a numeric value of 1-9

.. code-block:: python

	help 1

.. code-block:: python

	help 1-9
