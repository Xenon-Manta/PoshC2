  Apache Rewrite Rules
#########################

When running PoshC2 over the Internet its best practice to use a C2 Proxy server, usually in the shape of a small VPS from any provider. This is so that you can hide behind a web server when the Blue Team are investigating a suspected breach but also to remove the need for your Windows host to be fully connected to the Internet. Using Apache Rewrite rules we can redirect traffic that is intended for the C2 server but also retain a fully functional web site on the same host that does not hit our Rewrite Rules. 

To help with this Nettitude created a short blog which explains one way of achieving this using a VPS with OpenVPN. Another alternative would be to use a Windows Cloud server to host all the infrastructure with a perimeter firewall.

Once you've setup the external infrastructure you will need to configure Apache to rewrite your C2 traffic back to the PoshC2 instance. Thee example below details a default C2 server instance. However, when you setup your PoshC2 instance, PoshC2 will generate you a unique Apache2.conf file including any customization options selected. You will need to enable some modules on Apache before running the server::

	apt-get install Apache2
	a2enmod ssl 
	a2enmod rewrite 
	a2enmod proxy
	a2enmod proxy_http
	a2enmod headers

Then load the following rules (or your custom rules) within your Apache configuration file for each virtual host::

	<VirtualHost *:80>
		RewriteEngine On
		RewriteRule ^/images/static/content/(.*) http://<IP ADDRESS>/images/static/content/$1 [NC,P,L]
		RewriteRule ^/news/(.*) http://<IP ADDRESS>/news/$1 [NC,P,L]
		RewriteRule ^/webapp/static/(.*) http://<IP ADDRESS>/webapp/static/$1 [NC,P,L]
		RewriteRule ^/images/prints/(.*) http://<IP ADDRESS>/images/prints/$1 [NC,P,L]
		RewriteRule ^/wordpress/site/(.*) http://<IP ADDRESS>/wordpress/site/$1 [NC,P,L]
		RewriteRule ^/true/images/77/(.*) http://<IP ADDRESS>/true/images/77/$1 [NC,P,L]
		RewriteRule ^/holdings/office/images/(.*) http://<IP ADDRESS>/holdings/office/images/$1 [NC,P,L]
		RewriteRule ^/steam(.*) http://<IP ADDRESS>/steam/$1 [NC,P,L]
		ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost
		DocumentRoot /var/www/html
		ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
		CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined
	</VirtualHost>
