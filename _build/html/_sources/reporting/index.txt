Reporting and logging is an extremely important part of running a Red Team engagement and PoshC2 ensures all commands and hosts compromised are logged to a central sqlite database. It is always worth noting that PoshC2's timezone will work off the local Windows time, so if you are working in multiple countries or another time-zone, it is highly recommended that your time-zone is configured accordingly otherwise all log entries time sync will be out when performing log analysis or the debrief. 

Prior to execution, it is highly recommended that all C2 infrastructure is tied to the same time source/time-zone, and select an appropriate NTP server of choice.
