Mitre ATT&CK - `Powershell <https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1086>`_

An HTA (HTML Application) file can be either uploaded to the client and run manually using "Mshta.exe" or executed via a download link. If the user is using Internet Explorer the download is seamless but will prompt the user to execute the HTA, after the user has clicked this warning message the script will execute Powershell in the background (hidden) using arbitrary VBScript or JScript embedded in the HTA.

The HTA file can be edited to look and feel very much like a web page but the minimal code required is below::

    <script>
    ao=new ActiveXObject("WScript.Shell");
    ao.run('%windir%\\System32\\' + "cmd.exe" + ' /c $payload', 0);window.close();
    </script>
