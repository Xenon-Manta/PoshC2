By default on Debian these are **/opt/PoshC2** and **/opt/PoshC2_Project**.

Running PoshC2 in Docker
************************

You can build the Docker image after installing by issuing this command:

.. code-block:: bash

    posh-docker-build

Once this has completed, then edit the configuration file as usual with

.. code-block:: bash

    posh-config

Then run the server in a container with:

.. code-block:: bash

    posh-docker-server

Or as a service on *nix with:

.. code-block:: bash

    posh-docker-service

The Implant-Handler can then be started using:

.. code-block:: bash

    posh-docker -u <username>

All project content is stored in the project directory on the host.

You can clean the Docker containers and images on the host using the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    posh-docker-clean
